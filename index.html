                                <span class="first-letter">O</span>ur story began during the summer months of 2009 when both Chris and Jessica lived
                                at La Mirage in Mission Valley. At the time, we lived on opposite sides of the apartment
                                complex, yet our cars were assigned two stalls apart, so it was almost inevitable that we
                                crossed paths and began talking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the saying goes, one thing led to another and before we knew it, we were on our first official date at the Miramar Air
                                Show. This was memorable because the year prior, Jessica was Medical staff on the flight
                                line aid station all weekend. When Chris and Jessica went together, they attended an event
                                Chris had been given tickets to which involved front row seats on the flight line, catered
                                meals and a staffed bar -- a far cry from the experience the year before and much more exciting!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two have been inseparable ever since and eight years later, Chris proposed while visiting the Hawaiian Islands. Chris
                                had been planning to propose for a while, but when they got to Waipi'o Valley on the Big
                                Island of Hawaii, he couldn't imagine a more ideal place to ask Jessica for her hand in marriage.
                                Conveniently, a message in a bottle with a marriage request washed ashore at the same time,
                                so it was of course meant to be!

                                        frequently to reminisce about simpler days -- beach and hiking adventures, eating

                                        her when she was young, she wouldn’t be half as tough as she is today. The only time
                                        Therese and Chris have lived apart was while Therese went to school at St. Francis

                                        find her sipping a cold one at the river, on a hike, or at home cleaning up after
                                        her three animals.

                                        Mike and Chris went to El Capitan High School, played on the same high school basketball team, and shared similar friends
                                        while in school. Their network of friends has kept them in close contact over the
                                        years and as a result, Mike has become a close friend of both Chris and Jessica.
                                        If not writing source code while on the job, Mike can be found in the water surfing,
                                        on a dirt bike trail in Baja somewhere, or at home sweating fantasy football on the
                                        couch. Mike is a great friend and is hands down Maile’s (our dog) favorite person
                                        on the planet!

                                        Geoff is the youngest Miller sibling and with the turf received a healthy dose of mockery throughout his youth. As a result,
                                        it made him tough as nails, sweet as can be, and with a great sense of humor. Geoff

                                        military drills with South Korea. In his spare time he can be found free diving off
                                        of the Okinawa coast, sampling Japanese fare and libations. Geoff is stationed in
                                        Kaneohe Bay, O’ahu with wife Kat and their newborn son, Luke.
